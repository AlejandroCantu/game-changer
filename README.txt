Welcome to the Game Changer
This program is used to compile a list of games throughout NBA history that signify the moment at which an NBA future or current HOFer 'made the leap' in their game.

This 'leap' will be determined through using Basketball Reference's Hall of Fame Probability as well as Game Score, devised by Bill James.
